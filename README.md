This piece of software will send an email reminder to people on a list.
It is used to remind people of a team that the labmeeting is tomorrow in that room at that time and that person will speak of their results.

It can manage several teams, and several events, with or without a individual reminder sent to the person presenting.

You shouldn't use it unless you know what you do. It's just a quickly hacked stuff I made for our lab and lacks documentation.
